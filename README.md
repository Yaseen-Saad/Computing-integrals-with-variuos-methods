# Computing-integrals-with-variuos-methods
This project compares the accuracy of three numerical integration methods—Trapezoidal Rule, Simpson’s Rule, and the Monte Carlo Method. Each method is tested for  𝑛 = 10 , 100 , 1000 and compared with the exact solution using SciPy, with results visualized in a comparative plot.
